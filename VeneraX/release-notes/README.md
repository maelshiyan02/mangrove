# Release Notes (multi-language)

Each release ships **two** changelog files in this directory, one per language:

- `v<X.Y.Z>.en.md` — English (fallback for any non-Chinese locale)
- `v<X.Y.Z>.zh-CN.md` — Simplified Chinese

The file name version **must** match the git tag exactly (e.g. tag `v2.0.7`
→ `v2.0.7.en.md`). The app reads these at the tag-pinned raw URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kyosee/venera/<tag>/release-notes/<tag>.<lang>.md
```

## How the in-app update dialog uses them

`lib/pages/settings/about.dart` (`_fetchChangelogLines`) picks the language by
`App.locale`: Chinese → `zh-CN`, everything else → `en`. If the localized file
is missing it falls back to `en`; if neither exists the dialog simply omits the
changelog section.

The dialog renders **one entry per line** as a bullet list. Parsing rules
(`_parseChangelogLines`):

- Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) are dropped.
- Lines wrapped in `**...**` (e.g. the Full Changelog footer) are dropped.
- Leading list markers (`-`, `*`, `+`) are stripped.
- Blank lines are ignored.

So keep every user-facing entry on its own line as a `- ` bullet under a
section heading.

## GitHub Release body

The release body should link to both language files so users on the web can
switch language. See the `venera-release` skill for the exact body template and
publishing flow.
