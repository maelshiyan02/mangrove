/// Pure decision logic for WebDAV data sync.
///

/// numbers, or FILE selection lives here as a pure function so the whole
/// protocol is unit-testable and auditable in one place. IO, locking and UI
/// stay in `data_sync.dart`; nothing in this file may import app state.
///
/// ## Protocol summary
///
/// The server holds whole-library snapshots named
/// `<days-since-epoch>-<version>.<platform>.venera`. The numeric `version` is
/// the only ordering signal: higher wins (last-writer-wins). Devices track
/// their own position in `appdata.settings['dataVersion']`.
///
/// - Download: pull the highest-version backup if it is newer than local.
/// - Automatic upload: allowed only when the device is NOT behind the server
///   ([shouldSkipStaleUpload]); a stale device downloads to catch up instead
///   (#86). The new backup is stamped [nextSyncVersion] = above both local and
///   server max (#80).
/// - Explicit upload (manual button / local import / headless CLI): always
///   wins (`force`), preserving "this device is the source of truth" intent.
/// - Retention: after a successful upload, every platform keeps its
///   [backupRetentionPerPlatform] newest backups
///   ([backupsBeyondPlatformRetention]) so a bad upload can be rolled back
///   from the server's history.
